# Adaptive Multi-view Information Bottleneck for Multi-omics Data Clustering
## Introduction
This repository introduces scAMVIB, an adaptive multi-view clustering method based on the variational information bottleneck framework. Our approach uses similarity network fusion to construct an omics-fused sample matrix that captures intrinsic inter-omics relationships, while integrating it with distinct omics profiles to build a unified multi-view feature space—effectively redefining the analytical framework for single-cell multi-omics data.
